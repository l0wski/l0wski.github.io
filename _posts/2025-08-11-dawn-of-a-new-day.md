So for a while now, I've been wanting a place to express my thoughts and share some of my interests. I must admit, with great shame, that I attempted this almost two years ago, but never made it past the introductory post. This time it's different. What's different? Don't know. Maybe it's something in the air, I feel compelled to say something. About what? Don't know. We'll figure it out along the way.
